## What the heck is Tupsula?

Tupsula is a student house and commune located in Tampere, Finland. All of the house’s inhabitants are students of Tampere, with the majority being teekkaris (technology students). The house is owned by the Teekkari Foundation of Tampere and the local student housing foundation TOAS, the latter of which takes care of the building’s management and collecting rent.

In contrast to other student housing locations, Tupsula follows the concept of resident democracy, meaning that all decisions (including the selection of new residents) are made by the tenant committee, also known the Clan of Tupsula. Due to the small number of residents (42), all residents are able to belong to the tenant committee, which means everyone has the opportunity to have their voice heard.

Tupsula’s tenant activities have brought visibility to the house also from outside the student community, making Tupsula one of the strongest bastions of teekkari life in Tampere.
